    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Palm nut pulp</li>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Stock or water</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The palm nut pulp is extracted from ripe palm nuts by boiling them in water, then pounding or blending the softened nuts to release the creamy pulp.</li>
        <li>In a pot, the palm nut pulp is combined with water or stock, then simmered over low heat to create a thick, creamy base for the soup.</li>
        <li>While the palm nut base is simmering, meats such as chicken, beef, or fish are cooked separately until tender and flavorful.</li>
        <li>Chopped onions, garlic, and other aromatics are saut√©ed in palm oil until soft and fragrant, then added to the pot with the palm nut base.</li>
        <li>The cooked meats are added to the pot, along with any additional vegetables and seasonings.</li>
        <li>The soup is simmered over low heat for an extended period, allowing the flavors to meld together and the ingredients to become tender.</li>
        <li>Throughout the cooking process, the soup is stirred occasionally, and additional water or stock is added as needed to achieve the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Once the soup is fully cooked and the flavors have developed, it is typically served hot with rice, fufu, or other starchy staples.</li>
    </ol>
