        <li>Chopped onions, garlic, and other aromatics are saut√©ed in palm oil until soft and fragrant, then added to the pot with the palm nut base.</li><br>
        <li>The cooked meats are added to the pot, along with any additional vegetables and seasonings.</li><br>
        <li>The soup is simmered over low heat for an extended period, allowing the flavors to meld together and the ingredients to become tender.</li><br>
        <li>Throughout the cooking process, the soup is stirred occasionally, and additional water or stock is added as needed to achieve the desired consistency.</li><br>
        <li>Once the soup is fully cooked and the flavors have developed, it is typically served hot with rice, fufu, or other starchy staples.</li>
